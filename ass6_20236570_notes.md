### MA5114 Python Programming


## Assignment 6 Kevin Ryan 20236570

To complete this assignment, I carried out the following steps:
    
To start, I created a file in the MA5114 folder called `thesis`. 
    
Changed into this directory and made a markdown file by running `touch ass6_20236570_notes.md`.
    
Opened the tarball into by thesis directory by running this command from my MA5114 directory: `tar -C thesis -xvf prac21_20236570.tar`.
    
I already had git installed and configured on my computer. To install it, I would have gone to the website mentioned in the tutorial (http://git-scm.com/downloads). 
    
I would have run the commands as per the paper: `git config --global user.name "Kevin Ryan"` and  `git config --global user.email "kevinpa.ryan@gmail.com"` 
    
Then I changed into my thesis folder and typed `git init` which gave the following output: "Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kevin/Documents/MSc/MA5114/thesis/.git/"
    
I decided to commit all the files in this directory first. I would then finish off the markdown document and look at <code>git log</code> and <code>git diff</code>, as
well as detailing how I set up my github account, and the link to by github account.
    
I started off with the markdown file: `ass6_20236570_notes.md` and commited it to my local repository by doing the following: 
```    
git add ass6_20236570_notes.md
git commit -m "Adding initial version of markdown"
```

I added a few sentences to this file to test out a few of the things the tutorial suggested doing. I then ran `git diff` to see the change and got the following:

I then commited this change by running: `git commit -m "Added a couple of sentences to markdown file"`. I then undid this commit by running: `git checkout 112a1aa ass6_20236570_notes.md`.
    
I then made a repository on my github account called `thesis`. The local thesis repository was linked to the remote repository on the github account by running the command: `git remote add origin https://github.com/kevinpryan/thesis.git`
    
Then the command `git push origin master` was run to send the code to GitHub, which prompted me to enter my username (kevinpryan) and password (*REDACTED*). Then, all the files were staged and commited to my local repository with the following: 
    
```    
git add fastqc_script.py test_dataset/ trim_out/ fastqc_out README.txt trimmomatic_script.py
git commit -m "Adding all of the files, first try"
```

A few more changes were made to files, which can be seen in the output from `git diff` and `git log`.

To practise cloning a repository, I went into my home directory, initialised a new git repository from there and ran the following command: `git clone https://github.com/kevinpryan/thesis.git`. 
This downloaded a clone of the thesis repository in my home directory, which I made a changed slightly. I then committed it and pushed it to my github account. I could then go back to my original thesis folder, initialise a new local thesis repository and pull down the change from GitHub by running `git pull origin master`.
    
Finally, here's the link to my GitHub account if you want to have a look: https://github.com/kevinpryan/
