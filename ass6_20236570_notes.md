### MA5114 Python Programming


## Assignment 6 Kevin Ryan 20236570
    
To start I made a file in my MA5114 folder called thesis. I changed into this directory and made a markdown file by running `touch ass6_20236570_notes.md`
    
I then opened the tarball into by thesis directory by running this command from my MA5114 directory: `tar -C thesis -xvf prac21_20236570.tar`
    
I already had git installed and configured on my computer. I would have gone to the website mentioned in the tutorial (http://git-scm.com/downloads). 
I would have run the commands as per the paper: `git config --global user.name "Kevin Ryan"` and  `git config --global user.email "kevinpa.ryan@gmail.com"` 
    
I then changed into my thesis folder and typed `git init` which gave the following output: "Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kevin/Documents/MSc/MA5114/thesis/.git/"
    
I decided to commit all the files in this directory first. I would then finish off the markdown document and look at <code>git log</code> and <code>git diff</code>, as
well as detailing how I set up my github account, and the link to by github account.
